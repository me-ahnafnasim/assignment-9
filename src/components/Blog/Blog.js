                   <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500">React Router is a popular-library in the React ecosystem 
                   that provides dynamic routing capabilities to single-page applications (SPAs). It addresses
                    the need for navigation and URL management within React applications, enabling developers to 
                    create more sophisticated and user-friendly web experiences.

                   <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500">The Context API in React provides a way to share state between components without passing
                    props explicitly through every level of the component tree. It works by creating a centralized context object that holds 
                    the state, which can be accessed by components nested within a `Provider` component. Components that need the shared state 
                    can access it through a `Consumer` component or by using the `useContext` hook. This helps simplify state management, 
                    making it more efficient and avoiding prop drilling. Context API enhances code readability and maintainability by enabling
                     components to access and update shared state seamlessly.

                   <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500">The `useRef` hook in React is a built-in function that provides a way to interact with the DOM and manage references to 
            elements or values in a functional component. Unlike `useState`, it doesn't trigger re-renders when its value changes. 
            Instead, it maintains a stable reference across renders. `useRef` is commonly used to access and manipulate DOM elements, 
            create instance variables that persist across renders, or store mutable values without causing re-renders. It's particularly
             useful for scenarios where direct interaction with the DOM is required, or when you need to store values that don't affect 
             the component's rendering.</p>
